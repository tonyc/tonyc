      <description>Background Elixir and OTP excel at asynchronous and long-running tasks, and likewise, they seem like a great fit for interfacing with the non-Elixir world, particularly being able to shell-out and monitor a long running external OS process.
In the Ruby world, we often reach for tools like Sidekiq or Resque to run these commands asynchronously, outside of the normal HTTP request/response cycle that we&amp;rsquo;re used to when we usually build an app or API with Rails.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a software engineer based out of the Minneapolis/Saint Paul, Minnesota area.
I&amp;rsquo;m looking for work in Elixir/Phoenix, and would love to work as part of a remote team working on a product. If you&amp;rsquo;re hiring, I&amp;rsquo;d love to chat, so please get in touch!
My interests include Elixir, Ruby, GIS &amp;amp; geospatial data, and amateur radio.</description>
