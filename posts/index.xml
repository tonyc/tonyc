      <description>Background Elixir and OTP excel at asynchronous and long-running tasks, and likewise, they seem like a great fit for interfacing with the non-Elixir world, particularly being able to shell-out and monitor a long running external OS process.
In the Ruby world, we often reach for tools like Sidekiq or Resque to run these commands asynchronously, outside of the normal HTTP request/response cycle that we&amp;rsquo;re used to when we usually build an app or API with Rails.</description>
